BAT has in recent years focused on enhancing efficiencies at its manufacturing plant in Nairobi. The firm manufactures cigarettes for the local and regional market. It also produces semi-processed tobacco which it sells to markets such as Sudan. BAT’s net earnings dropped 4.8 percent to Sh3.8 billion in the year ended December 2019 on the introduction of a new levy (solatium) at a rate of two percent of the value of tobacco products.
