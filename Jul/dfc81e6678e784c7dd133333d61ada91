Hundreds of commercial disputes are set to stall once again after Chief Justice (CJ) David Maraga suspended physical court operations at Milimani Law courts for two weeks after a member of the Judiciary tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement issued Tuesday, the CJ said courts at Milimani will only handle urgent matters through the online platform. He, however directed heads of divisions to issue directions on the matters affected by the 14-day closure. The Milimani law courts host the bulk of courts including Commercial, Anti-corruption, Murder, Constitutional and Human Rights as well as Family divisions. Justice Maraga said the closure will enable Judiciary members to self-quarantine and thereafter will be tested before resumption of physical court operations. The closure comes about one week after Makadara law court was closed temporarily for 14 days after two members tested positive for the virus. Mombasa court, which was similarly closed after staff tested positive for Covid-19, was re-opened on July 6. On July 1, CJ Maraga launched the electronic filing of cases in Nairobi and statistics released by Judiciary shows that since then, more than 200 cases have been filed online. The CJ said as at July 8, over Sh3,836,518 had been collected as court fees, fines and bail in the courts. Access to the courts have been restricted since the outbreak of the pandemic.
