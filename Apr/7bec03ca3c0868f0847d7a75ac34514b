Kenyan suppliers with unpaid bills for goods and services rendered to the collapsed Abraaj Kenya Advisers Ltd will vote for the next course of action during a virtual meeting on May 4. In a gazette notice filed by the virtual meeting conveners, Ashish Patel (Abraaj Kenya managing director) said only creditors with verified claims would be allowed to vote on the consideration to wind up the firm. “Any creditor entitled to attend and vote at this virtual meeting is entitled to do so either in person or by proxy. Creditors wishing to vote at the virtual meeting must (unless they are individual creditors in person) lodge their proxy with the convener one business day before the meeting,” it says. Mr Patel and Mr Ikenya said a list of all creditors who have lodged claims would be available for inspection at the firm’s Nairobi offices at Norfolk Towers, Kijabe Street two days before the meeting. Secured creditors (banks or other asset-backed lenders) that wish to take part in the planned virtual meeting must surrender their security or provide proof of their security, the date it was given and the estimated value at which it was assessed.
