Supermarket chain Tuskys says it has temporarily halted trading in three branches to allow customers to shop in outlets with bigger space on the outbreak of coronavirus. Chief finance officer Martin Syuku told the Business Daily in an interview the new branches closed are in Nairobi, Kitale and Mombasa. Hundreds of businesses have been trying to stay afloat amid the outbreak, which has seen some firms enforce social distancing to contain the spread of the disease. The Covid-19 disease has so far lead to the death of 14 Kenyans, forcing the State to restrict movement in the Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties. “It’s a temporary suspension of our operations in those stores as we try to come out of the impact of coronavirus,” said Mr Syuku. “We want to operate in large stores that are not congested. We did not want the government to make that decision for us.” Mr Syuku said in Nairobi the Tom Mboya branch customers would be served from Tuskys Imara, which is 10 metres away on the same street. He added that Kitale Mega branch customers would be served from Kitale CBD branch. Customers at Digo road branch in Mombasa will be served from Bandari, which is 500 metres away on Haile Selassie road. He said workers in the three branches have been redeployed to other branches. “It’s a temporary shutdown of operations in those branches. Workers have been redeployed to work in other branches,” said Mr Syuku. Tuskys has faced intense competition despite the growth of the retail business, which has seen new entrants such as Carrefour rake in sales worth Sh18.7 billion last year. Last month, the retailer announced plans to send home hundreds of workers, citing a tough business environment.
