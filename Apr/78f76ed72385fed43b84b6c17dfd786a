Corporates, foundations, religious institutions and individuals have enthusiastically stepped forward to donate to the fund,” Ms Karuku said in the statement. The cash donations include Sh200 million by Safaricom, KCB Group (Sh150 million) and Sh100m each from Co-operative Bank and NCBA, and Sh50m from Absa Bank.
