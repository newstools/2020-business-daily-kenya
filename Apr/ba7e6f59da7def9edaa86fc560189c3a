ICEA Lion General Company CEO Steve Oluoch said Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) has already cleared Mr Muthaura for the new role. “With his track record as a champion for fintech adoption, his very broad exposure, rich career and diverse leadership experience, Paul will be of great benefit to the company and indeed to the ICEA Lion Group,” said Mr Oluoch.

Mr Muthaura joined CMA as senior legal officer for regulatory framework in September 2005 and rose through the ranks to become the CEO from July 2012 until his exit last year. During his 14-year stint at CMA, the organisation wad ranked as the most innovative capital markets regulator in Africa for five years in a row. He holds a master’s in Law (Banking and Finance) and a master’s in philosophy. Mr Muthaura is a member of Chartered Insurance Institute UK and served as board member of IRA and Retirement Benefits Authority.
