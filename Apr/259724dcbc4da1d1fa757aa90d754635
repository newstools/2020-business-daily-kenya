The sanitiser market could see a downward swing after the government released 400,000 litres of ethanol for manufacture of free sanitisers. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) said it had successfully applied for forfeiture of confiscated 398,345 litres of ethanol held as exhibits after owners failed to lodge claims. Consignments held at various locations were handed over to Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) for distribution to sanitiser makers who will in turn make 1.6 million bottles of 250ml hand sanitisers for free distribution. “On March 16, the President decreed that all ethanol held under any offences be released to KPC for making sanitisers to be freely distributed … in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic,” said ODPP. More ‘free-of-charge’ sanitisers are also on the way as hundreds of barrels containing ethanol are still held as exhibits pending hearing and determination of criminal cases. Mavoko, Kilungu, Nakuru and City Hall Annex had the highest seizures of unclaimed barrels containing 70,265 litres of ethanol.
