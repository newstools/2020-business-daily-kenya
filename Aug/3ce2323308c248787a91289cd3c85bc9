TripAdvisor, an American travel website, has ranked Nairobi's storytelling tour with street children among top tourist experiences in Africa. The tour allows visitors to give back as they enjoy a fascinating cultural experience of walking through downtown Nairobi. The guide, a former street child, shows tourists around the city centre's underbelly, telling tales of how to survive on the streets. Tourists walk from Bata Hilton Hotel and back through Nai Nami, Kenyatta International Conference Center, National Archives, August 7th Memorial Park, Tom Mboya Statue, Nairobi railway museum, Kariokor, and Jeevanjee Gardens. Some tourists choose to visit a hidden market or eat lunch at a kibanda eatery. Since the coronavirus pandemic started, tourists can watch the tour virtually and visit places they have always wanted to see, at the touch of a button. “We got a tour via Zoom. A little bit of traveling from your living room. After listening to their story we got more insights into how life is over there. It broadens your life view,” read a review on TripAdvisor.
