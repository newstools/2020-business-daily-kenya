Power generator Kenya Electricity Generating Company #ticker:KNGN (KenGen) has renewed the contract of Rebecca Miano as its managing director for a further three years. Board chairman Joshua Choge said the decision was taken after a "rigorous evaluation process" and her "exemplary performance" at the helm of the power producer. “During Mrs Miano’s three-year tenure, the company has continued on an upward growth trajectory, consistently reporting good corporate financial performance despite a difficult operating environment that has affected many other businesses globally,” he said in statement.
