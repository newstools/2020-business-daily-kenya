Agriculture Secretary Peter Munya has appointed a technical committee to vet employees at the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) as State kicks off a raft of reforms. The changes targeting previous cases of corruption will also affect the NCPB board, which Mr Munya says requires fresh expertise. He said he would in the next few days take measures to invigorate the NCPB board and inject the required expertise for oversight of the new functions. “To better ensure that NCPB as an organisation executes more effectively and devoid of historical burdens, I direct the technical committee and NCPB board to immediately undertake capacity and suitability vetting of all the serving officers,” said Mr Munya on Wednesday Other reforms lined up include establishing the National Food Reserve at the NCPB as the agency moves back to the business of buying and selling of maize and other grains under its commercial wing to make it financially independent.
