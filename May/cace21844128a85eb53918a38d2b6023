 194 lives have been lostÂ so far across the country since the onset of heavy rains and flooding. This is according to the government, with Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang'i saying those at risk in Garissa and Tana River counties may be forcibly moved to safer grounds. The Kenya Meteorological Department has also warned that the situation is not likely to subside soon as more heavy rains are expected this coming weekend, especially in parts of central, Coast, Rift Valley and Western regions. Floods are expected to accompany the rains. Kenyans in flood-prone areas have been urged to move to safer grounds especially with worrying levels reached in Masinga and Turkwel dams which are now threatening to overflow.
