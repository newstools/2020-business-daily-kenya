The World Health organisation (WHO) warned on Wednesday that coronavirus may never go away and people will have to learn to live with it. “It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan said. “I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be.” Dr Ryan said that just like HIV which has not gone away, the world must be prepared live with the new virus.
