Insurance companies are facing challenging times, especially those in health insurance following the coronavirus outbreak that has affected 1,029 Kenyans with 50 succumbing to the disease. Medical bills, which amount to more than Sh1 million per person may be challenging if the numbers are huge and the pandemic extends over a long time. Although pandemics are not covered in insurance contracts, Kenyan regulators have pushed insurers to cater for the costs raising the danger of elevated claims this year in a medical sector that recorded an underwriting loss of Sh75 million last year.
