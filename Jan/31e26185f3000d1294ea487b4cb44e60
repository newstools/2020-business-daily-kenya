Timber manufacturing industries in Western Kenya have embarked on massive layoffs following the logging ban in public forests in yet another highlight of State’s policy failure. Many timber mill workers from the region have said they fear for the worst with more than 20,000 people who rely directly and indirectly on the industry set to lose livelihoods. “Our employers have been honest and have been paying our salaries on time every month but we have now been issued with termination letters due to lack of raw materials,” said Christopher Mukeya, on behalf of more than 2,000 employees of Rai Plywoods Kenya in Eldoret. In November, the Cabinet ignored a recommendation of the parliamentary committee on natural resources to extend the moratorium on logging “to allow for maturity of forests.” The House committee in June called for partial lifting of the ban to allow Kenya Forest Service to sell mature trees which are rotting in some forests. Efforts by the State boost supply of raw materials by scrapping the 10 percent import duty on timber while retaining 25 percent duty on finished products furniture starting July last year, is yet to bear fruit. Data published by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows Kenyans ordered furniture (and related items) worth Sh6.23 billion in the first nine months of 2019, just a marginal drop compared to Sh6.47 billion in the same period the previous year. Timber mill workers in western Kenya have called on the government to reconsider the ban on logging in government forests. “We have been put under notice by saccos and banks which have started attracting penalties. We also have children in school, unless something is done they will drop out of school,” said Mr Mukeya. “Many employers will face difficulties in paying terminal dues for affected workers as they are facing financial constraints due to the ban. Some workers have worked for these companies for over 20 years.”
