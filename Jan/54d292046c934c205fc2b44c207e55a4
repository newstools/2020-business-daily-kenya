Kenya Airways   has suspended flights to and from Guangzhou, China following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that has so far claimed at least 213 lives. In a statement on Friday morning, the national carrier said the decision was reached after consultations with the government. “Further to our communication regarding the current coronavirus outbreak, we have taken a decision to temporarily suspend all flights to and from Guangzhou starting Friday, January 31, 2020, until further notice,” KQ said in a brief statement. The airline will, however, continue flying to Bangkok, Thailand, where 14 cases have been detected but no fatalities. “Our consultation with the Ministry of Health and Foreign Affairs will continue and we will provide updates as the situation develops,” the airline said. The move comes just hours after its workers, through the lobby Kenya Aviation Workers Union (Kawu), threatened to lead its members in boycotting work “if KQ does not stop flying to China in the next three days”. The airline’s acting chief executive Allan Kilavuka had on Wednesday said that the carrier would not suspend flights to China and that it was still monitoring the situation and would take action as soon as there’s imminent danger.
