Air connectivity was a major driver for growth in the number of tourists who visited Kenya last year with all the four Coast airports and airstrips witnessing increased traffic.

May and April registered lowest arrivals with 139,538 and 146,258 passengers respectively. The Moi International Airport (MIA) Diani Airstrip, Malindi and Manda Airstrips have greatly benefited from the increasing number of holidaymakers as shown by the Tourism Sector Performance Report 2019. In the report, MIA registered the highest growth in number of tourists at 8.56 percent while Jomo Kenyatta International recorded a 6.07 percent increase.

More than 63.1 percent of total tourists who visited Kenya last year were holidaymakers while 13.5 percent came to Kenya to do business. Some 10.6 percent of total international tourists came to Kenya to visit their families and friends whereas 12.75 percent came to seek other services such as treatment, shopping and education. The Coast region, the country’s tourism hub, had the biggest share of tourists, both internationally and domestic. Data from the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) indicates that MIA handled 600,533 international passengers last year compared to 542,481 the previous year, while domestic travellers recorded an increase from 858,725 passengers to 950,620.

The airport projects to handle more passengers in 2020, banking on the ongoing infrastructural expansion in relation to pavements and airfields ground lighting (AGL) with adequate space for business growth. Increasing number of direct flights last year also contributed to a sharp growth in the facility’s activity last year. Air France made its maiden flight in March 2019. “Qatar Airways started direct flights from Doha to Mombasa in December 2018. This was expected to serve various markets, Doha being a major connection hub, while Ethiopian Airlines increased flights frequency to Mombasa from one to two daily in the year hence boosting further arrivals via MIA,” read the tourism report.
