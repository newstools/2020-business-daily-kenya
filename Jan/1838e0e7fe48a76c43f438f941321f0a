The East Africa Cables   share Monday fell by 5.2 percent at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) to a six-month low after SBM Bank Kenya published a liquidation notice on the manufacturer. It closed at Sh2.37 a share, compared to Fridayâ€™s Sh2.50, reflecting negative investor sentiment to the winding up notice that may end up costing them their investment if successful. SBM filed the notice after EA Cables defaulted on a Sh285 million loan, which it has been unable to restructure. The bank invited other parties supporting or opposed to the petition to send their representatives on February 4 when the matter will be mentioned at the High Court. The share price fall Monday left investors in the firm holding paper wealth of just Sh600 million, having endured a sharp erosion from Sh4.02 billion over the past five years when Cables and its parent firm TransCentury  (who hold a 68.38 percent stake) have faced financial headwinds. The liquidation notice comes even as the firm marked a return to profitability in the six months ended June 2019 with net earnings of Sh634 million in the period compared to a loss of Sh303 million in June 2018.
