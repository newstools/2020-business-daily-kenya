Kenyan retailer Naivas has opened its sixty-third store in Mountain View with two more branches planned in a few months. The retailer has been on a massive expansion of its branch network following the sale an estimated 30 percent stake to France-based private equity (PE) fund Amethis Finance. “I reiterate that the Nairobi county’s population is still fairly underserved, particularly with fresh, quality and consistent food items,” said Willy Kimani, the Naivas chief commercial officer. The other two outlets lined up for opening are Kilimani and Naivas Imara branches in Nairobi, both of which are expected in the second quarter. This is the second branch that Naivas has opened in 2020, the first being the Kamakis store on the Eastern Bypass. The firm has partnered with the motorcycle delivery service Glovo to boost its e-commerce service.
