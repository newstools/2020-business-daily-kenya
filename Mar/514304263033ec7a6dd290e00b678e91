MPs have asked the Treasury, the Attorney-General and the Transport minister to table a toll charges bill on short notice. And the lawmakers want to pass it before they go on recess in May. The Nairobi-Nakuru, Nairobi-Mombasa, and some bypasses are listed as the key links that will attract tolls. With such collections in place, it is possible to convince investors to put money in building more roads; indeed, part of the revenues is used in repaying loans for building roads. Coming up with the architecture and why it is required is the easy part, the harder climb is sustainability, which brings to mind the reason similar endeavours were shelved decades ago. One, the toll stations were turned into a gravy train for officers managing them. Two, some of these stations ended up causing untold traffic snarl-ups, leading to more losses than the collections, thus hurting the economy. Should the bill become law, the step should be free of unnecessary hiccups and interferences tied to theft, corruption, malfunctioning systems and bureaucracies that may leave the country with beautiful roads that serve no one. Every plan to build more roads should get right the goal of free flow of traffic to transport manpower, goods, and services with as limited hitches as possible. We ask the agencies tasked to come up with the bill to deliver a legislation that will drive, not stifle, growth.
