ANXIOUS PARENTS Some pupils who survived the stampede on Tuesday claimed that a teacher was chasing them to leave the institution after classes in the evening. However, there has not been an official explanation yet on the cause of the Monday stampede that left many in shock. Grieving parents of the pupils who died during the stampede on Tuesday morning gathered at the Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary to identify their bodies. At the same time, other anxious parents assembled at the school from early Tuesday. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha, Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang and Kakamega Governor arrived at the school on Tuesday morning to assess the situation. Also present was Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, former Kakamega senator Dr Boni Khalwale and Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna. The leaders went into a meeting with senior county security and education officers and the schoolâ€™s management. Pupils and their parents were also assembled in the school waiting to be addressed by the officials. Earlier, the parents had been barred from accessing the school compound and waited anxiously outside the gate. They were later asked to register with their children's class teachers. PAST TRAGEDIES Tragedies that have occurred in schools or affected students in the recent past include fatal accidents, deadly fires and the collapse of structures. In September 2019, the Education ministry revoked the licences of two primary schools in Nairobi over safety concerns. Education CS George Magoha closed Precious Talents Top School in Dagoretti and Pama Academy in Kangemi and ordered the affected pupils sent to public schools. The institutions had substandard structures. In January, three pupils died after lightning struck them at Mkulima Primary School in Kuresoi North Sub-County. At least 53 others were admitted to various hospitals in Nakuru County. Education officials partially closed the school and ordered the learners moved to the neighbouring Murinduko and Kerisoi primary schools, pending renovation of their classrooms. In September 2017, nine students died while dozens others were injured after a fire burnt down a dormitory at Moi Girls' School Nairobi. Parents accused the Ministry of Education of laxity in addressing such incidents.
