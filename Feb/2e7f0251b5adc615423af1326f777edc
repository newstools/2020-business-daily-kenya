Sugarcane farmers who snubbed the team appointed by the State to look into the woes of the industry are now seeking to have an audience with newly appointed Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya ahead of release of Sugar Taskforce report. The team, which had established a parallel task force after accusing former Agriculture Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri of sidelining them, claims there’s a plot to sneak in contentious issues long opposed by cane farmers. Through the Kenya National Alliance of Sugarcane Farmers Organisation (Knasfo) chairman Saulo Busolo, the cane growers pointed out that it is irregular to have the document released without being validated by critical stakeholders. “Going by the draft report we are concerned that there are attempts to delineate sugar regions into clusters to be managed by particular millers,” he said. He said it was unfortunate that most of the issues raised by farmers during field visits have not been factored in the report.
