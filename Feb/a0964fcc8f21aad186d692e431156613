The students will admitted for undergraduate degree programmes in law, commerce, financial engineering, financial economics, actuarial science, informatics and computer science, and communications. The I&M Bank Scholarship Fund with Strathmore University was set up in 2010 with its first cohort of 10 students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, benefiting scholars who attained a grade of B-Plus and above in their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams. As at July 2018, the programme had sponsored 20 scholars, spending Sh32.35 million. “Beneficiaries of this scholarship fund have ventured into various careers spanning from academia, actuarial science, banking, public relations, audit, journalism, risk management and entrepreneurship,” I&M Bank Foundation chairman Suresh Shah said in a statement. “I believe that this young academically gifted cohort of the 2020 beneficiaries will be empowered to be transformative leaders and also impact the society in one way or another at an individual level.” Strathmore University Vice Chancellor Designate Dr Vincent Ogutu said the institution has 22 partners in student financing, ensuring that the young generation get an opportunity to fulfil their dreams.
