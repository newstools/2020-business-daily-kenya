London-based Goldplat Plc reduced operating losses in its Migori gold mine operation by 56 percent to £301,000 (Sh39.1 million) in the half year ended December. The multinational’s local subsidiary, Kilimapesa Gold, had posted an operating loss of £686,845 (Sh89.2 million) a year earlier. Commercial production remains suspended after Goldplat was unable to raise the funds required to run the operation. However, it has allowed small-scale mining by local communities as a strategy of raising funds for maintenance. “The processing of artisanal tailings continues and operating losses are lower than would have been,” Goldplat said. Cash utilised in the operations stood at £141,000 (Sh18.3 million) in the review period compared to £388,545 (Sh50.5 million) the year before. The company says it did not incur any capital expenditure. Receipt of VAT refunds enabled the company to reduce its liabilities. “Kilimapesa has reduced liabilities to creditors by £521,000 (Sh67.7 million) during the six months ended December 31, 2019, mainly from the recovery of previously unpaid VAT reclaims,” the firm said. “During the six-month period, £523,000 (Sh67.9 million) of VAT reclaims have been paid by the Kenyan Revenue Authorities.”
