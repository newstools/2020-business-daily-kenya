A Kiambu investor has injected Sh120 million for infrastructure development on a 20-acre gated community in Ruiru’s Membley area that will contain 120 housing units. Eboss Investment company director Geoffrey Gitahi said they have drawn a masterplan for the property to enable buyers launch developments faster. “This is a controlled development area that has a minimart, a gym, for utility shops as well as an early education centre that we intend to develop and hand over to experienced operators on a 25 year lease,” he said. “The roads have been done and we shall retain a management role to take care of the gardens, security and provide garbage collection services.” The new project has also reserved a three-acre riparian section with recreation spaces. Mr Gitahi said customers wishing to have their properties built for them will pay Sh18.5 million for a three bedroomed house, Sh21 million for a four bedroomed unit and Sh24 million for five bedrooms.
