A court has ordered immediate deportation of four Chinese nationals detained for flogging their Kenyan worker at a hotel in Nairobi. Milimani Principal Magistrate Hellen Okwani made the order Wednesday following an application by the immigrants to be deported back to China after staying in police custody for 18 days. The four were arrested on February 9 after one of them was filmed caning a Kenyan employee at Chez Wou Restaurant in Kileleshwa. Earlier, the immigrants named Deing Hailan, Ou Qiang, Yu Ling and Chang Yueping had opposed a decision by the Kenyan authourities to have them deported. The deportation decision was made by the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i on February 13. But the immigrants’ lawyer Brian Onyango filed an application that was certified urgent by Justice Luka Kimaru who also issued an order suspending the deportation. Yesterday, when the case was coming up for mention they vacated the application and said they had voluntarily decided to be repatriated. “The application is allowed. They can be repatriated to their country of origin, possibly the next flight,” said magistrate Okwani. The immigrants were arrested following a report by the flogging victim Simon Osako Silo who was employed as a waiter at the restaurant.
