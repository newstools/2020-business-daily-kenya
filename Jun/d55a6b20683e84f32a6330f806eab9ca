We can produce 40,000 masks during daytime and another 40,000 at night,” said Prof Kipkurgat yesterday, when Moi University donated 3,000 face masks to more than 1,400 police officers in Uasin-Gishu. “We presented samples to the Ministry of Education for the primary, secondary and university levels...We are well equipped as a firm for mass production to help the government fulfil its mandate.”
