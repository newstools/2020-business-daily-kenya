The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has benefited from Sh10.6 million worth of personal protective equipment as it seeks to sustain its operations and keep essential supply chains moving across the Kenya and neighbouring countries. KPA chairman Joseph Kibwana while receiving the consignment from the shipping logistics giant said the donation would help curb the spread of Covid-19. "The move by Maersk is a true testament of the solid relationship that exists between the two organisations. These items will go a long way to ensure our workers are protected as they discharge their duties," he said. Due to the adverse effects of the pandemic, the government was forced to downscale its operations at the port after several workers got infected. Maersk East Africa Port captain Sharon Delphine expressed the companyâ€™s commitment to continue supporting the Mombasa port to ensure business continuity. Maersk has so far supplied KPA with critical items such as hand sanitisers, face masks, and thermal thermometers, among other equipment. As part of the donation to the East Africa's largest port, she said "another batch of the donation including 12,000 pieces of protective face masks is expected to arrive from South Africa in a few weeks".
