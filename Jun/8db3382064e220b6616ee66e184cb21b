Bridge Academies says it is cooperating with the police on investigations regarding an alleged death by electrocution of a pupil at one its schools in Mukuru Kwa Njenga in Nairobi. “This tragedy was reported to the local authorities and the police immediately. The police opened an investigation into the case and visited the site of the accident the same day,” said the school in a statement to the Business Daily. “It is a criminal investigation into the owner of the property who was responsible for the illegal live electricity wire that was hanging over the school's fence,” it said. “Bridge and the wider community are supporting police investigation and while nothing will bring back this child, we hope that those responsible for the illegal electricity connection will be held accountable.” On Wednesday, Business Daily reported that World Bank’s investigative body, Compliance Adviser/Ombudsman (CAO), will investigate the alleged death by electrocution. “CAO is investigating the IFC's processes because of a complaint raised by EACHRights. It is important to understand the CAO process fully. CAO is not investigating Bridge and the IFC relationship. It is investigating the IFC's due diligence and processes. The World Bank is not probing Bridge,” the school said. CAO is an independent watchdog reporting to the World Bank and reviews complaints from communities affected by development projects its arms run.
