Qatar Airways has signed an agreement with UN Refugee Agency to deliver humanitarian relief to displaced people globally. Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker said they will closely work with governments and non-governmental organisations to prioritise the shipment of medical and aid supplies amounting to over 175,000 tonnes. “That is equivalent to 1,750 fully loaded Boeing 777 freighters. We are confident we will overcome the current adversities with strength, solidarity and resilience,” he said. UNHCR Gulf Cooperation Council countries senior advisor and representative Khaled Khalifa said UNHCR’s primary focus was to safeguard lives of the most marginalised and vulnerable members of society. “With limited access to water, sanitation systems and health facilities, refugees are at risk right now and we are developing key responses to mitigate these challenges, alongside our respected partner, Qatar Airways,” he said. Items to be airlifted include lifesaving support-water, medical care and hygiene materials. Qatar Airways Cargo flies to several international destinations across Africa, Asia, Europe, The Americas and Oceania. GCEO Al Baker said they had increased operations to support global trade, especially transport of essential supplies and relief goods to impacted regions. The airline’s freight division operates a significant cargo schedule with approximately 180 cargo flights per day riding on its freighters and belly-hold passenger aircrafts. The freight only and operating special freight charters for vital global supply chains operate to multiple countries including China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Poland, United Kingdom, the United States and Australia.
